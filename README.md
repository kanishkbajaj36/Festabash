# Android Mobile App Repository

Welcome to our Android Mobile App repository. This repository contains all the necessary components to build, manage, and deploy our mobile application. Below you will find a detailed description of each directory and its contents.

## Directory Structure

- `backend/` - Contains all the backend code necessary for the app's functionality. This includes APIs, database management scripts, and any server-side logic.
- `admin_panel/` - Contains the code for the admin panel. This panel is used for managing app content, users, settings, and more.
- `android/` - This directory houses the Kotlin code for the Android app. It includes all the activities, services, views, and other components required to run the app on Android devices.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a few prerequisites installed and properly set up. Here is a quick checklist:

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to work on the Android app.
- Ensure you have [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/using-gradle.html) set up in your Android Studio.
- For the backend, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or any other backend technology that you have used in the `backend/` directory.
- The admin panel may require [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/), depending on how it was developed. Please check the `admin_panel/` directory's README for more details.

## Running the Application

### Backend

Navigate to the `backend/` directory and follow the instructions in the README.md file located within that directory to start the backend server.

### Admin Panel
